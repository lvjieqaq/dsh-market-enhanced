## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dshmarket
```

Restart `dsh web`, then open **Settings → Plugin Market**.

## What you get

- **Browse & search** the full community catalog (230+ plugins, growing daily) — category filters, star counts, top/new sorting, bilingual descriptions that follow your UI language
- **One-click install** — confirm the source, watch live progress; most plugins go live after a page refresh, no restart
- **Updates** — per-plugin update checks (npm version or pinned commit vs HEAD), one-click update; the market updates itself the same way
- **Uninstall** — two-step confirm; plugins installed this session are removed live
- **Zero jargon** — if a component is missing (pnpm), the market detects it and offers a one-click automatic setup
- **Log export** — one click produces a sanitized plain-text log for bug reports (home paths and credential shapes are masked; nothing is ever sent anywhere)

## Speed

Installs prefer npm tarballs over full-repo GitHub downloads whenever a plugin publishes to npm (registry-verified against the repo to prevent name squatting). Registry installs are typically seconds; GitHub-only plugins depend on your connection to GitHub.

## Security

- Installs are restricted to sources listed in the curated [awesome-dsh-plugin](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com) registry — anything else is rejected
- Build scripts stay blocked by default (pnpm ≥10); allowing one is your explicit per-package choice
- Terminal/CLI-surface plugins are flagged before you install them into the web profile
- The install endpoint accepts same-origin POST only; the market never phones home
- Listing ≠ endorsement: plugins are third-party code, install sources you trust

## Data source

Live from [awesome-dsh-plugin.com/plugins.json](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/plugins.json) — curated entries, npm mapping, and star counts refreshed daily by CI — with a bundled snapshot as offline fallback.
